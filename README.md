Full stack ecommerce website for my mother store.

My mother as an antiques store in tel aviv and it is way
to expensive to pay someone to build it for us...

So we need to build it ourself...

This means a fullstack solution for website frontend based on the model-view-viewmodel pattern and a backend for user managemnt, products database and paying system.

Projects guidelines:
1. To make things as coherent as possile all stack would hopefuly work on javascript.
2. Security must always be in mind, there is money involved.
3. As I will work on this project on my free time there might be long gaps between work sessions, so everything need to be well documented.
4. The minimum amount of money should be spend on the process. 

Let's talk about the stack:

Frontend:

Vue.js framework - mainly cause Vue is much simpler and more comfortable to learn with better documentation then React.

Backend:

Nodejs for all backend coding
Probaly would use apache or something on an ubuntu vps (Should problay look this up)
Usermangment - heard about passportjs
Database - mongodb
